MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe, machine to machine network protocol for Message queue/Message queuing service. It is designed for connections with remote locations that have devices with resource constraints or limited network bandwidth.

In this project, a free MQTT hosting server is used available on https://mqtt.eclipseprojects.io/ with port -1883.
Two devices are used to communicate with each other as publisher and subscriber. 
A laptop and a mobile are the devices.
'MyMQTT' app is used on the android device to connect with the MQTT server and recieve or publish the message.
